# Exercise 6: Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 6)

# What will the following code print? Why? 
# Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# Answer: The code will print Breakfast to the screen because the method
# explicitly returns it; therefore, the code below it isn't executed.

# Introduction to Programming
# Hashes
# Exercise 7


Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

Answer:

In my_hash, the key x: is a symbol (data type) that has a string (data type) as its value called "some value"

In my_hash2, the key is variable that points to string (data type) called "hi there" that also has a value called "some value", which is also a string.

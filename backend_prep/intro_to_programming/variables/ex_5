Introduction to Programming
Variables
Exercise 5

Look at the following programs...

case 1
x = 0
3.times do
x += 1
end
puts x

and...
case 2
y = 0
3.times do
y += 1
x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? 
case 1: x prints 3
case 2: puts is unable to access x since it's outside the scope

Do they both give errors? 
case 1: no error occurs
case 2: error occurs

Are the errors different? Why?
No, since case 1 has no errors

What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

  Answer: The interpreter is expecting a closing curly bracket '}' since there's an open curly bracket somewhere in the program.

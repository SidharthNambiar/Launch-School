Practice Problems: Easy 1 - Question 2

Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby.

And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?

  Answer:
  - The != is the inequality comparison operator.

  - It returns 'true' if the both operands aren't equal
    to each other.

  - You should use it to test whether a condition is 'true' or 'false'

2. put ! before something, like !user_name

  Answer:
  - Putting ! (logical NOT operator) before something reverses
    the logical state (boolean value) of the operand.


3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!

  Answer:
  - Putting ! after invoking the uniq method on 'word', 
    will mutate the caller, in this case 'word'.
    
  - In this example (words.uniq!), the ! is part
    of the method name, and not Ruby syntax.

4. put ? before something

  Answer:
    - Putting ? before something doesn't do anyting.

    - The ? is part of the ternary operator (?:)

5. put ? after something

  Answer:
    - Putting ? after something doesn't do anything.

    - There are method names that include ?, and usually
      return a boolean value.

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

  Answer:
    - Putting !! before something gives the boolean
      state of an object

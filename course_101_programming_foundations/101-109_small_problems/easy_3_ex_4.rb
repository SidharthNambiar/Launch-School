# Easy 3: Multiplying Two Numbers

# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, 
# and returns the result.

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1*num2
end


# Further Exploration

# For fun: what happens if the first argument is an Array?
# What do you think is happening here?

# Answer:
# If the first argument is an Array, then the elements in the 
# Array are replicated n(depending on second argument) number of 
# times in the same sequence.

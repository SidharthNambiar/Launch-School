// Introduction to Programming with JavaScript
// The Basics
// Exercise 8

// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index 
// that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

var foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
foo.length;  // returns 3
foo[3];      // will this result in an error?

// No, an error wasn't raised. Instead UNDEFINED data type was returned.

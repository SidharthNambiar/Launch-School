Exercise 5


Identify the Constructors for each of the following methods and classify each method as either a "Static" 
or a "Prototype" method:

substring 
Constructtor(s):String
Type: Instance method

create
Constructtor(s): Object
Type: Static method

fromCharCode
Constructtor(s):String
Type: Static method

slice
Constructtor(s):Array, String
Type: Instance method

Multiple constructors may provide some methods; be sure to list them all in your answer. 
You can limit your search for methods to the String, Object, Array, and Number constructors.
